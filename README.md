## Discussion

### General

This application is a single-page website that advertises a complex type of real property for sale and allows readers to contact the seller to begin discussing a possible purchase. The site’s objective is to explain the unusual features of the property to prospective purchasers.

### Origin

This project is being developed at [Learners Guild][lg] in the course of an apprenticeship in full-stack web development. The project members are/were Learners in the apprenticeship phase, where they work on a mixture of open-source and commercial projects with actual users.

This application has catalyzed the project members’ further mastery of:

  - Single-page navigation
  - Web-email integration
  - Text-image integration
  - Transitions and animation
  - Website aesthetics
  - Usability
  - Responsive design
  - Accessible design

The tools used in the implementation include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, [Bootstrap][bs], and [Popper][popper].
